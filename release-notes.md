1. Now the sync backend supports the new `flexible` mode. (MongoDB Atlas will never support the previous 'partition' based sync anymore. This is an update for new users only.)
2. Fixed a searching bug in the tag/folder view.
3. Fixed the preference window overflow bug.
4. Fixed a bug when drag a PDF onto a tag/folder directly.
