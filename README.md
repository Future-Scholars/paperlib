📣 **I'm looking for someone to work with me on developing Paperlib.** 📣

If you are interested please contact me.

## Introduction

I'm a computer science PhD student. Conference papers are in major in my research community, which is different from other disciplines. Without DOI, ISBN, metadata of a lot of conference papers are hard to look up (e.g., NIPS, ICLR etc.). When I cite a publication in a draft paper, I need to manually search the publication information of it in Google Scholar or DBLP over and over again.

**Why not Zotero, Mendely?**

- A good metadata scraping capability is one of the core functions of a paper management tool. Unfortunately, no software in this world does this well, not even commercial software.

- A modern UI. No extra useless features.

What we need may be to: import a paper, scrape the metadata of it as accurately as possible, simply organise the library, and export it when we are writing our papers.

That is Paperlib.

## Highlights

- Scrape paper’s metadata with many scrapers. Support writing your metadata scrapers. Tailored for many disciplines.
- Fulltext and advanced search.
- Smart filter.
- Rating, flag, tag, folder and markdown/plain text note.
- RSS feed subscription to follow the newest publications on your research topic.
- Locate and download PDF files from the web.
- macOS spotlight-like plugin to copy-paste references easily when writing a draft paper. Also supports MS Word.
- Cloud sync, supports macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- Beautiful and clean UI.
- Extensible. You can write your own extensions.

### With Extensions, you have:

- Show citation counts.
- Summarize papers by LLMs.
- Automatically tag papers by LLMs.
- Semantically search your library with natural language, such as: 'papers written by Geoffrey in 2024'.
- Chat with LLMs about your papers.
- and more...
